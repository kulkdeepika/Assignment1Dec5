                <p id="text">My name is Deepika. I graduated with a bachelors degree in Electronics and Communications engineering in the year 2007. My work involved Hardware-software integration testing for aviation systems. 
                I am passionate about home organization and enjoy interior decoration. I also enjoy dancing and have participated in several community dance events. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I would like to explore a career in coding mainly because I find it interesting and challenging. I believe that hard work, persistance, courage and discipline are essential for success; but the most important thing is to push oneself harder and harder, believing that any hurdle can be overcome.
